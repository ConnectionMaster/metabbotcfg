This is the configuration for the metabuildbot - buildbot.buildbot.net

It is meant to be deployed as a subdirectory of the master's basedir, and
master.cfg linked to from that basedir:

basedir/master.cfg -> metabbotcfg/master.cfg
       /metabbotcfg/master.cfg
                   /workers.py
                    ...

The worker passwords are not included here - they are in *.pass files on the
local machine, which are read by the MyWorker class.

Note that this file is not intended as a good example of a buildbot
configuration - it's just what works for us!
